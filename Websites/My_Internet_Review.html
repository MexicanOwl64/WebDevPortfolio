 <h1>My Review of the Web</h1>




  <p class="review">The web is such a huge place to explore. It would seem impossible to review it, but I will try my best. I will first talk about one positive of the web and then talk about one negative and at the end I will give my personal rating of the web and why I gave it this score.   

    First letâ€™s talk about the good point of the web. It helps solve problems in everyday life.  Many of you have probably been stuck on that one math problem or maybe you forgot how to cut a watermelon.  With the web you can search the answer to these questions and maybe even learn a new technique or not.   
   
   Now for the negative if you do not have a good antivirus the web can be a dangerous place since there are hackers out there.  These people usually just do it because they can, but some will ask for money to give you access back to you.  </p>
  


   <p class="rating">I give the web a 4 out of 5 stars this is because it is a safe place if you have good cybersecurity otherwise, I would be cautious of visiting of random sites.  I always use the web to help me solve problems on stuff I forgot and it has always been very helpful.  </p>
